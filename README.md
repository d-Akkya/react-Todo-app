# React Todo App

React Todo App is a simple yet powerful task management application built using React. This application allows users to add, edit, delete and mark tasks as complete. The todos are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring the data persists even after the browser is restarted.

## 🌟 Features

- 📌 **Add Todos**: Quickly add new tasks to your list.
- ✏️ **Edit Todos**: Modify tasks as needed.
- ❌ **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks when they are no longer required.
- ✅ **Mark Complete**: Keep track of completed tasks.
- 💾 **Persistent Data**: Todos are saved in the browser's local storage, so you won't lose them even after refreshing or restarting the browser.
